                                        <p>On average, every year 23% of all people who are hired at UChicago Medicine live on the <dfn>South Side</dfn>. Many come from our strong partnerships with community workforce organizations, such as <a href="https://www.skillsforchicagolandsfuture.com/" target="_blank">Skills for Chicagoland’s Future (SFCF)</a>, where we hire an average of 100 people per year. Nearly 100% of people hired from SFCF are BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Color) and over 90% are still working at UChicago Medicine one year after completing the program.</p>
