CHWs are frontline public health workers who are trusted in the community. This trusting relationship enables CHWs to serve as a link between health and social services and the community members to facilitate their access to services and improve quality of life. CHWs play an essential role in UChicago Medicine’s community health programs dealing with asthma, diabetes, cancer screening and prevention, maternal health, and many others.</p>
