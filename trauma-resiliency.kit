The BHC Collaborative started in 2019 with a <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/trauma-articles/91-million-gift-bhc-collaborative-for-family-resilience?site=comer" target="_blank">$9.1 million gift</a> from the Ellen &amp; Ronald Block Family Foundation and the Hassenfeld Family Foundation.</p>
                            <p>Through funding and by working with the community, the BHC Collaborative has greatly expanded and improved trauma-focused programs at UChicago Medicine that help patients and their families at a critical time of need. While clinical care teams take care of physical wounds, these programs also focus on needs relating to mental, spiritual and emotional health; housing; legal assistance; employment; food security; and more.</p>

Since then, it has served more than 20,000 adult patients and another 3,000 pediatric patients. The Violence Recovery Program has served more than 8,000 patients.</p>

                            <p>In early 2023, the <a href="https://www.workforce-resilience.org/" target="_blank">Workforce Resilience Enhancement Project (WREP)</a> partnered with the <a href="https://app.verifiednews.network/articles/share/2901" target="_blank">From Adversity to Entrepreneurship (FATE) Project</a> to provide support to community members affected by trauma. As part of FATE 2023’s Learning Series, VNN Media Services <a href="https://app.verifiednews.network/articles/share/2901" target="_blank">adapted WREP resources</a> to develop a <a href="https://verifiednews.network/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Trauma-Informed-Business-Development-Toolkit-2023-V1.2.pdf" target="_blank">Trauma Informed Business Development Toolkit</a>. The toolkit is a resource to help employers understand how trauma can affect an employee’s ability to gain and maintain successful employment.</p>
